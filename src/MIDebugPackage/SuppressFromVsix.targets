  <!--This targets file is used to add additional dlls to the built in list of dlls which should be excluded
  from a VSIX.
  
  These files are included by default due to MSBuild's dependency include logic, but we don't ship them with 
  the MIEngine so therefore we want to make sure they don't wind up in the output directory either so we are
  testing the same way we will ship.
  
  You can test for any other dlls on the list by looking at the files in this directory:
  C:\Users\greggm\AppData\Local\Microsoft\VisualStudio\14.0Exp\Extensions\Microsoft\Microsoft MI-based Debugger\1.0.6
